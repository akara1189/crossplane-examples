This repo contains some basic examples of using Crossplane via a Kind cluster. It uses the Crossplane AWS provider to provision EC2 instances 
and an S3 bucket via a Localstack container. This is done to save potential costs on a live AWS account. Costs should be minimal if you decide
to run it live.

This demo assumes you've install Kind, Localstack, Helm and the Crossplane Helm repo. Any Kubernetes distribution should work fine and it really
doesn't matter how you install the other components before running any scripts. The scripts assume that all binaries are available from the current
user shell/context, via a PATH environmental variable, etc... - Change the paths in the scripts if necessary!

startup.sh: Startup script. Creates Kind cluster, starts localstack container and installs Crossplane to Kind.

shutdown.sh: Shutdown script. Doesn't do much. Shuts down localstack container and destroy kind cluster. 

kind-config.yaml: Contains Kind config for test cluster.

shell_functions.sh: BASH script file designed to be sourced by other scripts. Not doing much at the moment.

providers/: Contains YAML config files for Crossplane Providers and ProviderConfigs being used.
